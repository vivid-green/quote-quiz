## Description
This is a timed triva quiz to test your knowledge of who said what. You have 3 minutes to answer as many questions as you can. Each question answered wrong will result in a 5 second detraction of your current count down time. If all questions are answered within the time limit, you are a true master of quotes. If you run out of time...don't quote me on this, but I think you lose. Feel free to try again and break the highscore.

## Post-mortem
I learned a lot from this project. One of the main takeaways is dynamically creating html elements and event listeners and appending to the DOM. Placement of functions was crucial in obtaining the end result; specifically clearing intervals and resetting DOM elements. I would really like to revisit this project in the near future to refactor and condense lines of code. I'd like to practice jQuery and this project would be the perfect opportunity to do that. I spent a lot more time than I had anticipated to achieve a functioning site. Traversing DOM objects was somewhat tedious but I developed somewhat of a flow towards the end of development.
